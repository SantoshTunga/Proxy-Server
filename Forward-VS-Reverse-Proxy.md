The main difference between a forward proxy and a reverse proxy is the direction in which they forward traffic. 
A forward proxy sits in front of a client and forwards its traffic to the internet. A reverse proxy sits in front of a server and forwards traffic to it from the internet.

Another difference between forward proxies and reverse proxies is their purpose. Forward proxies are typically used to improve security, privacy, and performance for clients. 
Reverse proxies are typically used to improve security, performance, and scalability for servers.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between forward proxies and reverse proxies:

## Feature 
## Direction of traffic
### Forward proxy   
- flow	Client to internet	
### Reverse proxy
- Internet to server
  
## Purpose
### Forward proxy   
- Improve security, privacy, and performance for clients
### Reverse proxy 
- Improve security, performance, and scalability for servers
## Typical use cases
### Forward proxy 
- Bypass geo-restrictions, hide IP address from websites,                      
  cache frequently accessed websites.
### Reverse proxy
- Load balancing, SSL termination, caching, security

Forward proxy: A company might use a forward proxy to block employees from accessing certain websites, such as social media websites, during work hours.
Reverse proxy: A website might use a reverse proxy to distribute traffic across multiple servers, improve security, and cache frequently accessed resources.
Both forward proxies and reverse proxies can be useful tools for improving the security, privacy, performance, and scalability of your network.
