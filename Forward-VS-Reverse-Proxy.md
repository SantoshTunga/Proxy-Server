The main difference between a forward proxy and a reverse proxy is the direction in which they forward traffic. 
A forward proxy sits in front of a client and forwards its traffic to the internet. A reverse proxy sits in front of a server and forwards traffic to it from the internet.

Another difference between forward proxies and reverse proxies is their purpose. Forward proxies are typically used to improve security, privacy, and performance for clients. 
Reverse proxies are typically used to improve security, performance, and scalability for servers.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between forward proxies and reverse proxies:

## Feature - 	              - Forward proxy   	                                                            - Reverse proxy
### Direction of traffic -    flow	Client to internet	- Internet to server
### Purpose	             -    Improve security, privacy, and performance for clients	                      Improve security, performance, and scalability for servers
### Typical use cases	   -    Bypass geo-restrictions, hide IP address from websites,                       Load balancing, SSL termination, caching, security
                              cache frequently accessed websites

Forward proxy: A company might use a forward proxy to block employees from accessing certain websites, such as social media websites, during work hours.
Reverse proxy: A website might use a reverse proxy to distribute traffic across multiple servers, improve security, and cache frequently accessed resources.
Both forward proxies and reverse proxies can be useful tools for improving the security, privacy, performance, and scalability of your network.
